Gliberator.py
-------------
A little script to make G+ posts readable again
It will remove the sluggish JavaScript interface and extract the HTML-only posts
Then it will invoke 'open' on the extracted HTML to open it in the default browser

[!!!] Note: I tested this only under OS X. The 'open' command is probably not 
present under Linux. You'll have to adjust the 1st system() invocation 
to suit your OS.

Syntax:
  gliberator.py <url of G+ post>

Example:
  ./gliberator.py https://plus.google.com/101960720994009339267/posts/hoJdanihKwb

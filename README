Gliberator.py
-------------
A little script to make G+ posts readable again
It will remove the sluggish JavaScript interface and extract the HTML-only posts
Then it will open the extracted HTML in your default web browser

  gliberator.py <url of G+ post>

Example:
  ./gliberator.py https://plus.google.com/101960720994009339267/posts/hoJdanihKwb

glibber and glibber.py are scripts that will strip html (using pandoc) and pipe the post through less
for glibber to work glibber.sh has to be in $PATH
